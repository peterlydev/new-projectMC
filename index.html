    <p>Today has been a very productive day. After patiently waiting for weeks. Out Mitnick Cohort began today and it has been a wonderful 1st day experience. We started off by meeting and greeting each other. We then entered our first lecture in which we learnt the basics of HTML and CSS with Sergi and Emile. The lecture was very engaging and very enjoyable and taking regular break was also a great bonus. Below you will see what I ate for lunch today followed by what I like to watch on weekdays.</p>
